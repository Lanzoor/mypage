        <h2>About me</h2>

        <p>
            Hello there! 👋<br>
            I go by the name of <b>Lanzoor</b>, but you can also call me <b>Lanzy</b>!<br>
            My pronouns are <b>he/him</b>, and my Japanese name is 光星 蘭蒼瑠 (こうせい らんそうる) but you can still call me ランジョア.<br>
            I also have a few more aliases, but I don't regularly use them. (Lapis Lazuli, 光星 蘭蒼瑠 & 廃星 虚冥魂)<br>
            I live in <b>South Korea</b> 🇰🇷 (UTC+9).<br>
            I enjoy doing lots of things, but I am just going to name a few:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                🌐 <b>Studying languages, linguistics, and making conlangs.</b><br>
                I am already a polyglot, but I still want to experience lots of languages for my conlangs.<br>
                I can speak Korean and English pretty fluently, and can speak some Japanese and Chinese.<br>
                I'm also currently studying Dutch, and interested in studying Greek and German.
            </li>
            <li>
                💻 <b>Making random programs and learning programming languages.</b><br>
                I usually work on Linux, but I do not want to force myself into lots of intense programming work. I usually just make documents (like this!) or make small utility programs.<br>
                I am usually expected to write code in Python, because it suits the best for me. I am trying game development via <code>pygame</code> nowadays, but I also make interactive CLIs with Python.<br>
                I am also able to write some code in JavaScript and TypeScript. I started programming by learning JavaScript, so I know lots of things about JavaScript.<br>
                However, I still need to improve at actual web development in JavaScript. Also, I know most of the TypeScript features.<br>
                I am currently learning how to write code in C and Rust. It's not in my priorities for now, but I still want to create more CLIs with them.<br>
                ...and there's the markup languages. I can write HTML, CSS, Markdown, and some LaTeX. But only if you consider them actual programming languages.<br>

            <li>
                🔬 <b>Studying science.</b><br>
                I like most sub-branches of science, and especially <b>🧪 chemistry, 🔭 astronomy, and ⚛️ physics.</b><br>
                It's not that I am very good at any of these, but I want to study them because it's genuinely fun for me. I especially love astronomy, because I had interest in it ever since I was young.<br>
                Studying science isn't in my top priorities anymore, but when someone brings up the topic, I am still going to like it.
            </li>
            <li>
                🎮 <b>Playing games.</b><br>
                I especially like <b>idle/clicker/incremental games, rhythm games, puzzle games, (self-claimed) anime games, space simulation games, and platformer games.</b><br>
                I don't really like <b>horror games, adventure games and RPG games</b>, though.<br>
                I play games everytime I feel like it, or I am stressed out because of everything.<br>
                Recently however; I have been returning to programming again, so I don't play games all day unlike what I used to do before.<br>

                🎧 <b>Listening to music.</b><br>
                I really, <i>really</i> like Japanese music. I mostly enjoy PJSK songs and vocaloid songs, but I sometimes listen to general J-Pop.<br>
                I also listen to some electronic music (like Camellia, Kobaryo, and the entirety of TANO*C) but only occasionally. I always put music on when programming or working on anything.<br>
                I like discovering random music, and occasionally looking back at Geometry Dash music. (brings me a lot of nostalgia)
            </li>
            <li>
                I also enjoy drawing, watching anime and YouTube, and talking to my good friends.

            That said, if you have any suggestions for any of my conlangs or my works, please DM the Discord user <code>lanzoor</code> and ask me about your inquiry!<br><br>
            Thanks for reading this to the end! I will add more stuff about myself later on, so please check here frequently, but only if you'd like :3
